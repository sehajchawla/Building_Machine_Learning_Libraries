# Building_Machine_Learning_Libraries
In this repository I use first principles in the math of intelligence to build my own customisable libraries.

I have not used any of the popular machine learning libraries so that I can facilitate my knowledge in the first principles of the math, which can later be used to gain an insight and foresight into the different models available.
